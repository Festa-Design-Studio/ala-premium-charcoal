# Àlá Premium Charcoal Atomic Design System

![Àlá Premium Charcoal Logo](img/logo-ala-horizontal.svg)

## Overview

The Àlá Premium Charcoal Atomic Design System is a comprehensive component library built using the principles of Atomic Design methodology. This design system provides a consistent and scalable UI framework for building digital touchpoints that maintain Àlá Premium Charcoal's premium brand identity.

The atomic design system follows the methodology created by Brad Frost, breaking down interfaces into their basic components (atoms) which can be combined to form more complex structures (molecules, organisms, and templates).

This approach ensures consistency, maintainability, and scalability across all brand touchpoints.

Each color includes multiple tints and shades (50-900) for versatile application across interfaces.
